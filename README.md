## Recommendation System 🧠
Our recommendation system is based on a linear regression model using historical data from January 2023 to August 2024. The system includes:
* Demand predictions considering adjacent zones
* Historical data analysis by:
  * Hour
  * Day of the week
  * Month
* Detailed recommendations for highest predicted demand zones
* Comparative analysis between best zones based on predicted demand and driver's current zone

## Key Performance Indicators 📈
### 1. Trips per Zone and Hour
* **Description**: Measures total trips initiated in each zone and hour
* **Goal**: Maximize fleet availability in high-demand areas and times

### 2. Total Revenue per Zone
* **Description**: Measures total revenue generated in each pickup zone
* **Goal**: Identify and optimize the most profitable zones to maximize revenue

### 3. Average Trip Duration per Zone
* **Description**: Measures the average duration of trips initiated in each zone
* **Goal**: Optimize routes to reduce average trip duration

## Communication 📢
### Regular Meetings
* **Daily**: Morning stand-ups
* **Weekly**: Progress reviews
* **Product Owner**: Regular updates

## Risk Management ⚠️
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Data Delays | Identify alternative sources |
| Data Inconsistencies | Implement rigorous validation |
| Requirement Changes | Maintain regular PO communication |
